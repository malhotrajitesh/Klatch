She also suggested that Vogue had become an increasingly uninspiring read. I was fired.” Fired. Also, Man Repeller interviewed a bunch of fashion industry insiders LITERALLY days before the Lucinda Chambers interview hit Vestoj, which offers a refreshing — but still honest — take on the fashion industry, specifically print magazines. Vulnerability isn’t a bad thing — it’s a more ubiquitous human trait than cheek dimples, when you think about it — but it can be terrifying when it seems like you’re the only one experiencing it. Lucinda Chambers attends the Mulberry Winter '17 LFW show at The Old Billingsgate on Feb.19 in London, England. “There’s too much smoke and mirrors in the industry as it is,” she says. I’m not ashamed of what happened to me.”, The most startling revelation, to me at least, was her honesty around the impact big advertisers could have on the creative process: “Oh I know [my shoots] weren’t all good – some were crappy. We rarely admit to being fired immediately after it’s happened, when the wound is still fresh and you’re navigating the world with wide eyes like a newborn, untethered from the lifeline of the career you were building, not to mention your source of income. Lucinda Chambers, shown here at a spring 2017 Balenciaga show, said in an interview with the journal Vestoj that the fashion industry could “chew you up … She was also fashion director for British Elle, working there for seven years. She has worked with They’ve stopped being useful. I’m a bit late to the Vogue leaving party – but our Greek island-hopping holiday wasn’t a complete digital detox and I did spot Lucinda Chambers trending online earlier this week. Many industry power players in Paris were tight-lipped after the article was published, including Mr. Enninful, who said he had “no comment” about the interview as he sat in the front row of the Chanel show on Tuesday. “Nobody today is allowed to fail, instead the prospect causes anxiety and terror. Chambers could not be reached for comment. As she said, “It took them three minutes to do it.” Chambers worked at British Vogue for 36 years, and spent 25 of those as Fashion Director. Ms. That’s not to say that being smart, creative, thoughtful and a good leader aren’t important in fashion, as in almost any other industry, but what she’s saying is that “looks” can carry you to a unique degree. Cart; July 6, 2017 “Hell hath no fury like a fashion editor fired” by Taylor Sperry. Chambers went on to criticize some of the “crap” magazine cover shoots that she had produced (saying the blame lay in part with Vogue’s allegiances to major advertisers), and the mismanagement of the fashion brand Marni, where she had once worked. Not sure what the story is? The management and the editor I’ve worked with for 25 years had no idea. Vogue magazine’s former Fashion Director, Lucinda Chambers, has published a candid interview in Vestoj magazine, about life after Vogue, which has Conde Nast’s lawyers all over it. And with good reason. He’s a big advertiser so I knew why I had to do it. Probably expected, but Condé Nast is not pleased with former fashion editor Lucinda Chambers’s brutal takedown of the fashion industry. “What magazines want today is the latest, the exclusive,” she continued. Julie Zerbo, of the website the Fashion Law, looked beyond the reader reaction and to the possible legal fallout, wondering on Twitter if Ms. If you haven’t read it, read … It took them three minutes to do it.” In those two short sentences, she revealed multitudes: not only does she admit to being fired (a rare confession in fashion media, where shuffling from publication to publication is quite common, making it beneficial to keep quiet about a dismissal, lest it hurt your chances of being hired elsewhere), but she also pointed a finger at British Vogue (Vogue! I was also fascinated by Chambers’ commentary on how, in fashion, a projection of confidence is more important than confidence itself. A rise in copying call-outs on Instagram and … You’ve got them in a state of anxiety.”, Anxiety is a common thread throughout the interview. As an example, she cites the ousting of a designer she worked under at Marni, Paulo Melim Andersson: “The CEO at the time asked my advice about Paulo and I told him, ‘Paulo is great, but you have to know that he won’t turn the brand around for you in a season or even two.

Changing the Narrative: Learning from Lucinda Chambers Vestoj Interview 4 July 2017 If you love fashion, especially the industry gossip, you probably read the Vestoj interview with former British Vogue fashion editor Lucinda Chambers. “We hope Lucinda’s republished interview will spark a discussion which might, in her words, lead to a more ‘empowering and useful’ fashion media.”. Again. “Truth be told, I haven’t read Vogue in years,” she said. When I met with my editor after having had my baby, she told me about her. Lucinda Chambers, Fired Vogue Director, Gives Fashion Industry a Kicking, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/04/fashion/vestoj-lucinda-chambers-british-vogue.html, Lucinda Chambers, shown here at a spring 2017 Balenciaga show, said in an interview with the journal Vestoj that the fashion industry could “chew you up and spit you out.”, multiple screen captures and photographs of its contents, subscribe to Vanessa Friedman’s Open Thread Newsletter. Dozens of readers, meanwhile, were quick to praise Ms. Chambers’s candor. It’s a word fraught with so much anxiety, despite how common an experience it is. I think this general assessment of the importance of conveying confidence could be applicable to any industry, but Chambers goes on to discuss an aspect of it that does seem particularly endemic to fashion: “When I was on maternity leave, Vogue employed a new fashion editor. It wasn't particularly shocking at … Chambers said in the interview. After all, it helps us grow and develop. Fashion is an industry grounded in aesthetics. That’s why Lucinda Chambers’ tell-all is so provoking — jarring, even: she’s standing behind it, 100% out in the open.
