It makes me wonder how she ever ended up as a Lesbian, and what that word meant to her. How is Wittig's approach to feminist and queer theory evident in our society today? Also, in the post-war period was the very first strong. Rather, femininity is a construction of civilization, However, now, race, exactly like sex, is taken as an “immediate given,” a “sensible given,” “physical features,” belonging to a natural order. “One is not born a Woman, But Becomes One”. Her essay “The second Sex” is a masterpiece which inspired the second wave of feminism in the 60´s. For example, instead of seeing giving birth as a forced production, we see it as a “natural,” “biological” process, forgetting that in our societies births are planned (demography), forgetting that we ourselves are programmed to produce children, while this is the only social activity “short of war” that presents such a great danger of death. If you will forgive the pun, methinx such feminist theorists – I don’t understand why this is so hard for some women to conceptualize. or intellect. Excellent, Mary. Either way. Once the class “men” disappears, “women” as a class will disappear as well, for there are no slaves without masters. “Woman” is there to confuse us, to hide the reality “women.” In order to be aware of being a class and to become a class we first have to kill the myth of “woman” including its most seductive aspects (I think about Virginia Woolf when she said the first task of a woman writer is to kill “the angel in the house”). SHE WAS INVOLVED IN GROUPS SUCH AS Les Féministes Révolutionnaires AND Les Gouines Rouges (THE RED DYKES). of differences in their situation. That was classic (from you, to me): always addressing my most frustrating questions about feminist theory and history. For many others it means someone who fights for woman and her defense– for the myth, then, and its reinforcement. Thus a lesbian has to be something else, a not-woman, a not-man, a product of society, not a product of nature, for there is no nature in society. Could you explain further your criticisms that if she is overlooking the importance of sex and reproduction, then she must be marxist? Obviously, it is a critical diff. Which is why so many post-mods love these particular writers, and even some more recent reincarnations like Judith Butler. In his 2016 memoir Born a Crime, comedian Trevor Noah recounts his childhood in South Africa under the apartheid government and the first few years of democratic rule by the nation’s black majority. The authors main argument is that one is not born a woman but: becomes a woman through growing up and becoming a member of society. which oppression has granted us, and it does not radically question the categories “man” and “woman,” which are political categories and not natural givens. Simone de Beauvoir said: “One is not born, but becomes a woman”. Rain, Rain, Rain. (p.1) 8, mai 1980. The cultural future of women according to Simone de Beauvoir But that is not the end of the story. Surely, the words “it’s a boy” or “it’s a girl” are statements naming some biological reality that is usually beyond any doubt. What I quoted from the article in an earlier comment is relevant to your question, I think: It is not clear whether Wittig means that SEX is not an eternal category, or whether she only means “gender” is not eternal and can *therefore* be destroyed. De Beauvoir believed that woman wasn’t born a woman rather she becomes one, in that under the aegis of femininity she is in fact following the dictates of an ideal, largely created by men, to ensure that man keeps his place as top dog in a patriarchal society.  I interpreted Marxism in Wittig’s philosophy because her focus is so much on the MATERIAL aspects of oppression. There *is* a natural, body-based division between males and females: reproduction ala sexual dimorphism. - Thief37. One Is Not Born A Woman One Becomes One. They upheld the illogical principle of “equality in difference,” an idea now being born again. Today this double accusation has been taken up again with enthusiasm in the context of the women’s liberation movement by some feminists and also, alas, by some lesbians whose political goal seems somehow to be becoming more and more “feminine.” To refuse to be a woman, however, does not mean that one has to become a man. Simone de Beauvoir, The Second Sex (New York: Vintage Books, 1973), 301. I don’t understand what is so confusing or difficult about ISOLATING reproductive functions– and reproductive functions ONLY– as the singular characteristic shared by female humans that would necessarily remain in an otherwise “sexless” society. Additionally, much attention should be paid to the educational practices which legitimize inequality. Thus, as long as we will be “unable to abandon by will or impulse a lifelong and centuries-old commitment to childbearing as the female creative act,” gaining control of the production of children will mean much more than the mere control of the material means of this production: women will have to abstract themselves from the definition “woman” which is imposed upon them. and is incredibly misogynistic because the reason they dissociate from women is because they conflate women with “person fucked by men” and internalise men’s victim blaming for rape. I agree– she conflates lesbianism and feminism. They fell back into the trap which threatens us once again; the myth of woman. It was first published in French as « On ne nait pas femme » in the journal Questions Féministes , no. Can the classes of women and men every be completely destroyed and what other factors impact the classes? http://storify.com/JamesPomar/one-is-not-born-a-woman-1981-monique-wittig. Woman can be generally broken down to that which produces a body from within its body - the creative aspect of the self. One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. It is still the same method of finding in women and men a biological explanation of their division, outside of social facts. A central figure in the lesbian and feminist movements in France, she was the founding member of the Gouines rouges (Red Dykes), the first lesbian group in Paris. Marxism has traditionally focussed quite a lot on the importance of those issues and how they are used by powerful forces in various (male-dominated) class societies. It is, then, this movement that we can put in question for the meaning that it gave to feminism. The refusal to become (or to remain) heterosexual always meant to refuse to become a man or a woman, consciously or not. Furthermore, they still believed as men do that the cause (origin) of their oppression lay within themselves. But before being seen that way, they first had to be made that way.) and find homework help for other The Second Sex questions at eNotes It so happens that feminism in the last century could never resolve its contradictions on the subject of nature/ culture, woman/ society. MONIQUE WITTIG (1935-2003) WAS A FRENCH RADICAL LESBIAN THEORIST. One because we do not know what a person is really thinking … But for them these features were natural and biological rather than social. Born in Haut-Rhin, France in 1935, Monique Wittig was a feminist way ahead of her times. Wittig also says that the idea of a natural woman does not exist and femininity is created by society. It leads us to develop with complacency “new” theories about our specificity: thus, we call our passivity “nonviolence,” when the main and emergent point for us is to fight our passivity (our fear, rather, a justified one). Women started to fight for themselves as a group and rightly considered that they shared common features as a result of oppression. Shulamith Firestone and Marge Piercy have immortalised this whole idea in their writings, in saying that the only way women-as-a-class can be “free”, or “equal” or “human”, is to lose the biology altogether, and be biologically reconstructed somehow, eg using extra-uterine artifical reproductive technologies. I *understand* where women who argue this are coming from, although dont agree with it. Also, the Marxism, yes. I completely agree, Mary. ( Log Out /  ( Log Out /  This, we lesbians, and nonlesbians as well, knew before the beginning of the lesbian and feminist movement. We owe Simone de Beauvoir so much. It represents the logical continuation of the proofs de Beauvoir offers in Book I to support her argument that femininity does not arise from differences in biology, psychology, or intellect.
