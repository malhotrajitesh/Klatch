Janice Brooks 		2:04 pm. Tyler Dudley 		November 10, 2016		 @ Maria Jackson has recorded 16 studio albums, three greatest hits albums, two Christmas albums, and two gospel albums. Trust me, one day it will be as clear as day that Alan Jackson is truly the Nickelback of country music; it will be his fate to go down as the next Nickelback, a laughing stock. He is nothing compared to Beyonce. 		11:33 am. He’s nothing but a corporate puppet/sellout, and trust me, he will not be remembered. That was a waste of CMA  airtime that real artist such as Alan Jackson, George Straight, Brad Paisley, Carrie Underwood just to name a few could have entertained viewer’s. I totally called this! Never listened to country music again. 		1:45 pm. She is a black supremacist. 		3:20 pm. In the aftermath, many entertainment outlets accused the CMA’s of “scrubbing” all record of Beyonce’s performance after some racially insensitive comments were left on social media, but it was later revealed the CMA’s removed the posts at the request of the Beyonce camp. Nice try, bud. 		 I changed the dial after. The concert with Alan Jackson and Brooks and Dunn at the Pepsi center was awesome!!!!! Sometimes the simple moves or gestures can have powerful effects. Sandra Alan disrespected the performer. 		3:17 am. 		 Again, for the probably the 5th or 6th time: Beyonce wasn’t officially announced as a performer by the CMA’s until roughly two hours before the start of the presentation, and we have no idea if Alan Jackson was informed of this even at that point. 		November 9, 2016		 @ Alan Jackson Lyrics "Good Time" Work, work all week long Punchin' that clock from dusk till dawn. Wrongo! 		November 14, 2016		 @ CMA can Kiss Off! J S Tuvie 		November 12, 2016		 @ It’s about time someone in country music remembered and had balls to stand up for real country music and not that crap they call country music today. And you are one of them. The story of the history-making Nottingham Forest team that won back-to-back European Cups in 1979 and 1980, led by the mercurial Brian Clough and his assistant Peter Taylor. Scotty J Alan Eugene Jackson (born October 17, 1958) is an American singer and songwriter. Brenda Thompson Good for Alan. 		November 28, 2016		 @ So much wrong in this comment. 		November 9, 2016		 @ Hell like all Hollywood show biz gatherings n awards it coulda been forced and unathetic and just set up by managers bc of how pop country is and or bc she may not be a country singer but loves music and is in the music industry and as a Georgia girl with a soul voice could sing a hella good country song n be less fake than these new aged fake pop country stars n sound better n more genuine…. It certainly changes my opinion of some “stars”. AMEN! Look at the mess that left America in. Allen Jackson is a disgrace. 		November 9, 2016		 @ 		12:14 pm, CountryCharm 		 This event has always struck me as bizarre in so many ways. Marian 		 Kay Hairrell I grew up on Hee-Haw, and Porter Wagoner, and Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs. The rest was a disjointed mess, complete with Brad and Carrie’s terrible jokes. For her childs sake I would think her stylist and she would choose modern yet a bit more modest clothing. It’s bullshit that he didnt know she was going to perform. He could have pulled the plug on his performance. In 2002, Alan Jackson released the sentimental song titled “Remember When” as the second single from his Greatest Hits Volume II album. Probably have a hard time finding any takers!!!! 		 		November 10, 2016		 @ On another note, I would love to know the executive’s name who asked Beyoncé and Dixie Chicks to perform in the first place. Looks like I spotted the Hillary supporter. So awesome. 		 		 thehornet 		12:42 pm. Trust me, one day it will be as clear as day that Alan Jackson is truly the Nickelback of country music; it will be his fate to go down as the next Nickelback, a laughing stock. 		November 10, 2016		 @ 		1:34 pm. So Alan Jackson basically invented bro-country. 		6:06 pm. Who are you to judge, you say your not but your entire comment is a judgement. #AlanJacksonKilledCountry, Greg 		4:50 pm, STFU! #AlanJacksonKilledCountry, Eddie666 Grandma D, Watch the AMA Awards show if you like RAP CRAP. 		November 9, 2016		 @ The entire country music stars in that room should have walked out. 		 Way to go Alan Jackson! #AlanJacksonKilledCountry, Peri Jetton 		5:38 pm, Amen Brother…….I respect Alan so much…..wish others had the ——-to take a stand……wish Travis, Kenny and others had, Carole 		9:45 am, Summer Jam Country Music is serious business for Alan Jackson and it’s his life, love and passion. 		 I suggest you listen to some Alan Jackson to calm down. 		9:09 pm. In 1975 John Denver and Olivia Newton-John both won awards. Most music awards shows these days have people like this Beyonce, and very few Rap Crap singers. Nothing but the utmost respect for the man, the legend………Alan Jackson!!!

November 11, 2016		 @ I mean, there’s been room for Shania Twain, Taylor Swift, Sam Hunt etc etc over the years…, I guess I just hate the “you’re not welcome here” sentiment that was a lot of people’s response, even if it wasn’t coming from a racist place, seak05 Is that all anyone can think of is black and white? 		 It’s not alright to be a red neck, and he started the brocountry disaster. 		 The only good parts of the show were Stapleton/Yoakam, Church, and the opening segment. 		November 10, 2016		 @ You know what a bigger stand would’ve been Mr Alan Jackson, when those jackasses I’m sure that’s true of the best bar band in Bergen County, NJ, too. Someone needed to take a stand against those who are not country for taking part in what was supposed to be an anniversary for country music and it has absolutely nothing to do with what color a person is. This guy is a danger to real country music, and arguably the biggest disgrace to country music in its entire history. Alan Jackson, (born October 17, 1958, Newnan, Georgia, U.S.), American country music singer-songwriter who was one of the most popular male country artists of the 1990s and early 21st century.. Jackson grew up in rural Georgia singing gospel music and performing, as a teenager, in a country duo. 		 (That wasn’t exactly “country music” either, but I really liked it. It was Alan Jackson who killed country music by dumbing it down (i.e., that stupid 9/11-exploiting song where he couldn’t tell the difference between Iraq and Iran) and living up to stereotypes (i.e., “It’s Alright to Be a Redneck”, “Where I Come From”, “Country Boy”). Carlene L Hanson 		2:50 pm. I don’t feel either of them have a place on that stage with such greats as Loretta Lynn, Alan Jackson, Reba, George Strait to name a few. 		November 10, 2016		 @ Now ,if that ain’t country, I don’t what is. 		November 10, 2016		 @ Did get it says they are KNOWN by it. if I were her friend I would offer my opinion. You sound like you’ve got a chip on ya shoulder fella. Artist: Alan Jackson Song: Here In The Real World / CAPO 1 / [Intro] G A D G D / [Verse 1] D G Cowboys don't cry, A D And heroes don't die. I was telling my dad before Beyonce performed that I hoped Alan Jackson just got up and left. 		 Download backing music in midi and CD formats. As a music fan, I appreciate the fact that the CMA’s are embracing talented artists for collaborations. Good for him. My guess is Alan simply had little interest in the performance, and quietly took the opportunity to go visit the men’s room. Trigger I’ve been commenting here long before Beyonce was a twinkle in the CMAs  eye. Therefore, to me, whoever had the idea of having her come was pretty much saying that they have no faith in country music having the ability to stand on its own two feet without the help of someone from another popular musical format. Alan Jackson is what destroyed country music. Rumors that Jackson walked out on the performance have been swirling ever since the CMA’s, but it wasn’t confirmed by anyone on site until an unnamed Nashville manager who was sitting near Jackson during the awards spilled the beans to Billboard. 		2:03 pm. [4], Billy Dukes of Taste of Country rated "I Believe" 4.5 out of 5 stars and calls it "arguably the best of the 13" and shouldn't keep him from earning a Song of the Year consideration. 		6:29 am, James Mooney 		March 22, 2021		 @ Lynne Fairchild Why not when Miranda smashed the guitar? 		3:46 pm, “Disrespect for people is never something that should be celebrated.”. 		November 11, 2016		 @ 		 Bc at least Beyoncé isn’t Taylor swift and all the other so called country singers who are flat out pop and taking over country music with their pop n claiming n preyed if to be country, she made no attempt ever to be a country singer …..And she is a Georgia corn fed girl …. 		 		November 9, 2016		 @ Just so sad….. N again not Beyoncés fault country has long ago went to shit and pop and at least she’s not one of many non soul voices one of the many country style ppl n singers envading, pretending, disguising, faking and lying n saying and thinking they’re country and not blatant pop. #AlanJacksonKilledCountry. Nothing but respect for this true country man! 		November 9, 2016		 @ Big man of Campus, huh Alan. Someone writes a song they put a pop beat to it then sell it to the artist who only wants the return from the millions they make then over charge for tickets and people call it country LIARS. 		November 9, 2016		 @ 		5:36 pm, I hope so I need to shake his hand for that as well, Marian being his stuff. I am a long time fan of both Dixie Chicks and Beyoncé. Perhaps you would feel more comfortable with the Dove Awards & Christian Music. How are we to know what country music can do on its own if people from other musical formats are always going to have a presence? Nice try though. 		 		 		5:12 pm. I am African American, I listen to all music. Chris His loyalty & admiration for my all time hero, George Jones, never hurt either  This is a man who I broke out of the hospital with double pneumonia at 14 because of just so wouldn’t miss his concert. He’s so honest, so average and so down to Earth that he’s “the voice of the common people” more than any other singer. 		 It just sucks that THIS is what they’re choosing to speak up about, albert I don’t believe it’s rude to make a stand for something you believe in and against something that almost everyone else in the industry doesn’t have the courage or power to do. 		5:45 pm. I remember after it was announced last year that Alan Jackson and Cole Swindell would sing a duet together and the ACM awards, I joked on this site that I hoped Alan Jackson had one of his acts of rebellion planned and that he might fling Swindell off the stage and into the front row as soon as he started singing. Joe Finch 		 "I Believe" debuted and peaked at number 50 on the U.S. It just didn’t fit the night to me, celebrating the 50 years, and the Dixie Chicks seemed like her backup band on it, without enough of a real shout-out to them. What bothers me the most is how Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley have stood on stage and made fun and mocked Taylor Swift. 		 This guy is a danger to real country music, and arguably the biggest disgrace to country music in its entire history. 		 TX Music Jim In fact, if you’re sensibilities are offended by George’s drinking songs, Dolly’s tits, DAC’s cheating songs, Cash’s murder lyrics, Merle’s prison tunes & Waylon’s hellraising music…you can change the channel cos the music won’t change for you. Sorry I missed his show It was Alan Jackson who killed country music by dumbing it down (i.e., that stupid 9/11-exploiting song where he couldn’t tell the difference between Iraq and Iran) and living up to stereotypes (i.e., “It’s Alright to Be a Redneck”, “Where I Come From”, “Country Boy”). The are not Bob Dylan. Trigger with the hiway men. Did alan sleep with your wife? How rude. NOT! Great music; SEXY performer. 		1:11 am, I am glad you said that, as a Christian, I just feel she is dressing way too sexy to be proclaiming her faith…not judging her soul or heart. It’s a weird mix of hip-hop and hair metal. Well not until 2020 when Michelle Obama becomes President, then you can Alan’s “music” is nothing but corporate manufactured drivel, recorded and released solely for the purpose of desecrating country music and its rich history. 		 		January 25, 2018		 @ Like for the white house for a Obama party! 		5:42 pm. 		 		7:21 pm, Way to go  Alan I’m with you 100% keep it Country. Why not Florida Georgia Line or Luke Bryan ANYTIME, EVER? 		 		December 19, 2018		 @ No judgements, most true girlfriends tell the truth as They see it. Also, he made country music look ignorant, especially in his stupid 9/11-exploiting song where he couldn’t tell the difference between Iraq and Iran. What was the point?!? I’ll say it again, Alan Jackson is the Nickelback of country music. 		January 24, 2017		 @ 		 		9:38 am. 		 Holly As with anyone religious different people follow the religious covenants at different intensities of commitment. Donna In fact I don’t recall him being at many of the awards shows in the last half decade, and if he was, he likely wasn’t sitting in the front row. This guy is a danger to real country music, and arguably the biggest disgrace to country music in its entire history. criticize again. Pete Marshall A future country star may one day say that the Dixie Chicks and Beyoncé not only exposed them,  but inspired them to find their voice in music. What better way to make headlines than to put Natalie the Mouth Maines on stage with a half-naked diva pop queen such as Beyoncé. Did anyone stop and think Maybe A.J. Next year they going to have Kiss? Just like other artist in previous years, they bring an artist for a crossover performance, so I don’t understand the problem. 		 If in fact he did walk out as a protest , that shouldn’t surprise anyone who knows AJ . You should be ashamed of yourself!

I’d WANT you to do it (like I’ve wanted someone to do for so long). You seem angry. I don’t know that I would say it was disrespectful. Sarah I like to fancy Alan Jackson as “the everyman.”. 		 		November 9, 2016		 @ she is a disgrace   to woman let alone being close to country  I almost vomtted, Bob Sterenberg Good gosh. 		November 21, 2016		 @ 		12:52 am, hayda…..your a moron, AJ is country. 		 Nothing wrong with Alan Jackson having dignity and respect??? Farmer Brian 		3:22 pm, dave 		 		 For over 30 years, Jackson has been like a bulwark against the incursion of pop and hip-hop influences into the genre, and even though he may not enjoy the radio play and big awards anymore like he once did, he’s still doing what he can from his perch as a country music elder statesman to keep the genre on track. Alan Jackson produced four more number one hits, which were then followed by his first album that topped country charts titled A Lot About Livin’. Some interesting points there with respect to the Dixie Chicks, especially the backlash in 2003. I’m surprised Beyoncé didn’t goose step out to a black panther platoon like at the Super Bowl. 		 		 I hope he has a backbone. Additionally, considering Alan Jackson killed country, “Murder on Music Row” is basically the country version of Key and Peele’s video Rap Album Confessions. 		6:13 pm, I’m an OLD Texan, and has loved shit-kicking music my whole life; I mean down home stuff – fiddle, etc… That aside,  I really enjoyed the Beyonce/Dixie Chicks performance. 		November 9, 2016		 @ I lost it for the Dixie Chicks years ago when they trashed President Bush like they did. 		 So why just picking on her….None of the above should be judged and what about the long list of these new aged pop country singers that dress no less Beyoncé style as u described ….. It’s the new aged pop country that’s the prob not Beyoncé …. I personally thought the performance was excellent. It’s not ok. Trigger Nothing wrong with him walking out??? I’ve never listened to her songs though she has many fans. This just makes me appricate Alan even more! He played 		 just as non country singers who sing, are sometimes dedicated square Christians and or have made a gospel or country song. Are you serious? N woulda said no in the rare event they were sought up n begged to go main stream lol…. Your email address will not be published. 		November 10, 2016		 @ People are always talking about judgment like they know what it means, it’s obvious they don’t ; simply making an observation of something , isn’t judging at all; this what means when the Bible says” a tree is known by the fruit it produces, bares. 		 		November 10, 2016		 @ 		5:21 pm, Why was it wrong this wasn’t some multi type music performance last I knew that stuff she sings sure ain’t country she should expected someone to stand up and walk out I wish I could shake his hand for doing this that’s the best part of the show, gtrman86 Beyonce may be beautiful and have a good voice, but she doesn’t belong on a show featuring country music. 		March 30, 2019		 @ Lot’s of people like all kinds of music. CountryCharm Country superstar Alan Jackson will have you rejoicing in the Lord with ‘Amazing Grace.’ What a sweet sweet sound that is! People saying there were no protests against Justin Timberlake, Meghan Trainor and others are misrepresenting the truth. The chords provided are my interpretation and their accuracy is not guaranteed. Grandma D it is ALAN not ALLEN !!! It was released on July 15, 2013, as the second single from his album Love Is Everything. 		 Alan Jackson wasn’t at the 2014 CMA Awards. kay1954 New tradionalist I think he was called. 		12:03 am. 		2:05 pm, *standing up and walking out (obviously standing up during a performance is totally fine :p), Trigger 		12:02 pm, I’ll give you the stones to throw since you are a Christian and are so pure to judge people and are without sin, Tina Tatum 		 Very much like the bulk of Christian’s note themselves as Christian’s but only celebrate Easter for the turkey dinner, plenty Christianic individuals vary in how much of of the Bible that they stick to. Jack Williams He’s as country as Soulja Boy. And not to mention he covered Wiz Khalifa’s “We Dem Boyz” and Akon’s “Don’t Matter” at his concerts. Phillip 		12:33 pm. Well apparently Alan Jackson let his displeasure be known again at an awards show, though the cameras and much of the press didn’t catch it. 		 		 Yeah, hopefully it’ll be a good country music show for a change.”. Sheryl mccormick It is part of country music tradition. Scotty J 		3:16 pm. 		November 12, 2016		 @ Please provide evidence on the extreme attacks  from country fans and entertainers on Meghan Trainor and Justin Timberlake. 		November 10, 2016		 @ 		November 9, 2016		 @ 		8:56 am. Maybe you need to go back to church and learn that only God is the judge. can’t stand this new aged pop country ….. Of course he chose to be disrespectful of Beyonce’s performance. Brett Dale What better way to make headlines than to put Natalie the Mouth Maines on stage with a half-naked diva pop queen such as Beyoncé. Beyoncé could have been a mentor for young girls, but she decided to do trash music and dance like trash. 		7:47 pm. Grandma D 		9:17 pm. Reba is another little smart ass, I can’t stand that little red headed mouse. 		 		November 9, 2016		 @ He had several oppertunities to object but he chose to be disrespectful during her performance. "I Believe" is a song recorded by American country music  singer George Strait. It’s time people started standing up for country music and letting people like the dixie chicks and Beyonce who’s who! Kelsea Ballerini can barely sound competent vocally. 		 It’s not even unprecedented for Alan Jackson. 		11:55 am. Yes, there are always pop crossovers at these things … and they have always been railed against by traditional country fans and performers, including the Justin Timberlake performance. Beyonce did not belong on that show and certainly didn’t dress appropriately. Enough said. 		1:37 pm. I think things kike this is the reason why he still hasn’t been inducted into the hall of fame. Donations and contributions are tax-deductible as allowed by law. You don’t believe the Bible, which is the Christian standard of truth. 		 “I must of missed it or did the CMAs delete those too like they did with Beyonce?”. And to imply anything else is a lie, and is being used to accuse folks of racism and sexism, which is patently unfair to these people. That’s what makes what I’m about to say that much more disparaging. 		November 12, 2016		 @ The lyrics of this song were adapted from a poem written by a Jewish prisoner on a cellar wall in a WWII concentration camp. But I could have walked out, just because it was the Dixie Chicks. God bless you and country music always!!! My guess is that he either agreed with it (e.g., like Travis Tritt and Ricky Skaggs) or wasn’t about to jeapordize his career. At least you admit that he was being disrespectful to her. And if being among non country acts is where the Dixie Chicks would rather be, its no skin off my back either when they made it as clear as crystal glass years ago that they have no respect for country music by doing nothing but trash one country act after another after another after another: Toby Keith, Reba McEntire, Trace Adkins, Joe Nichols, and Jason Aldean. Donna Wassen 		 		November 9, 2016		 @ Beyonce is not exciting new horizons Grandma D!! Donna DAVIS 		November 9, 2016		 @ If he was protesting the assault on country music, why didnt he do it during his own performance, or in fact why did he not perform at all? 		4:40 am, George was right: There was “A Murder On Music Row”. 		 He’s nothing but a corporate puppet/sellout, and trust me, he will not be remembered. Also, not to mention that “Chattahoochee” is littered with bro-country buzzwords, so Alan Jackson pretty much invented bro-country. We know more about how important Christianity is to Jackson through his songs than through direct quotes from him. Beyonce/Dixie Chicks was bad, but at least in a vacuum, regardless of those artists social/political stances, they have talent. Do you not know that Alan Jackson is the man who killed country music? Maybe, bc he may not want country continue going to pop…. If he did not like the song, it is his opinion. 		7:55 pm, Gypsy truck, Austell Ga. 		 		3:42 pm. 		3:13 pm. She is very talented but tries to use her body for attention too much. As for Christians judging, the Bible teaches us to judge sin and immorality. 		 So sad n typical comment above from the so called Christian women who mentioned Christianity (of course not real bible teachings or Christ followings or love which = God and simply the same mainstream fake religion things, like focusing more on outside than in… Fake for show Christ followers who hardly if ever read bible (what bible warned most will be and simply those who want to appear godly only n never truly want or try to be) +  plus basic political religion, where u pick n chose what verses n biblical topics n verses tp discuss (like republicans only mentioning the same basic political sins and only politically religious and this fallacy that country music is Christian music) …… What a joke (not saying I want it to be and I in fact love the good ol partying county persona n songs of the last century)….. “Mommas and prison and getting drunk,” so godly, Friends in low places like getting drunk is godly, rowdy drunk friends settling down n not wanting to get overly drunk is so godly, according to ur standards u place on Beyoncé and her wardrobe….. Not …..  		11:42 am, Donna wassen 		 Your email address will not be published. 		4:55 am, Karen I agree. 		12:39 pm. Jackson’s “Small Town Drive-In” events Friday night in Cullman, AL and Saturday evening in Fairhope, AL are the largest live music events the U.S. has seen in over three months. 		November 11, 2016		 @ 		 		 …and now we know you’re a member of the Beyhive. If he felt that strongly about it, he should not have attended. The only lesson learned is don’t invite another black popstar. 		December 19, 2018		 @ As for walking out on the CMA’s, 90% of today’s so called ‘Country Music’, in no way resembles country music from 50 years ago. He walked out on an act that was not Country,pure & Simple! PS- I love how the wanna be Christian lady who commented on how ungodly n inappropriate Beyoncé looked, not only judged by that but didn’t mention the many others there that were dressed the same way, but especially how she tried to reply n defend her blatant judging by saying she was not judging but making an observation and opinion and God asks for us to do that and it’s not judging (I can’t scroll up to word for word it) ….. Lmao, that was without a skit judging u literally said that her outside appearance did not agree with what is godly …. Man, I remember back in the early 90’s Alan Jackson wasn’t considered “real country.”. Trigger 		November 9, 2016		 @ 		November 9, 2016		 @ Now the guy hung around long enough that he’s a certified legend, and he’s pulling bad ass stuff like this. I reread Trigger’S article and it doesn’t say one way or another. Dangles That was the point of walking out. Goes to see if Alan Jackson walked out during Miranda Lambert and Meghan Trainor performing a POP song during the CMA awards. Additionally, considering Alan Jackson killed country, “Murder on Music Row” is basically the country version of Key and Peele’s video Rap Album Confessions. 		11:50 am, Phillip So Alan Jackson basically invented bro-country.
