The President represents the people, and is their spokesman in domestic and foreign affairs.

It sheds a good deal of light not merely on the need for effective power if a society is to be at once cohesive and civilized, but also on the need for limitations on the power of governors over the governed.

The Attorney General also noted that the dispute at North American Aviation was Communist-inspired, and more nearly resembled an insurrection than a labor strike. Statements from a letter by the Attorney General to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, dated February 2, 1949, with reference to pending labor legislation, while not cited by any of the parties here, are sometimes quoted as being in support of the "inherent" powers of the President. request and delayed its threatened strike while the dispute was before the Board. plant, Baltimore, Md. § 9, Selective Service Act of 1940 as    2/4/46    2/13/46*  Properties returned after agree-    None.
