Burns's mentor, Dr. Aaron T. Beck found no evidence that psychoanalysis is effective in treating depression. One was ''Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy.'' - which was not helping me at all. David D. Burns, M.D., a clinical psychiatrist, conveys his ideas with warmth, compassion, understanding, and humor unmatched by any other writer in the self-help field. For the woman who's step daughter is abusive and rude to her and steals from her his advice is to just accept that this is how she is so as to not be upset over it (and not cause an issue with her spouse).
